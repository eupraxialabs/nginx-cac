# Dockerfile for a sample container that runs NGINX web server and uses it to
# do SSL client verification, trusting the DoD PKI.
#
# In other words you can login to this web server and require CAC just like DoD
# websites do, but without having to go through DISA IASE. :) :) :)
#
# NGINX will set headers in this config (see default.conf) to let you extract
# the serial identifier and the subject name if you wish.

# TODO: NGINX maintains an official Docker image... is it better to start from
# that?
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk update && apk add nginx && mkdir -p /run/nginx /www/data

# The Makefile will generate DoDRoots.crt (the DoD root + intermediate certs
# concatenated) by downloading the certs from the cyber.mil IASE website. NGINX
# needs these certs to setup the CA it trusts for client authentication.
#
# See also the default.conf's configuration where we permit NGINX to have
# multiple intermediate certs.
#
# The server certificates (*.pem) are generated by the Makefile.

# server cert and privkey respectively, then the DoD root/intermediate certs
COPY certificate.pem key.pem DoDRoots.crt /etc/nginx/

# Provided in this Docker package, and relatively simple configs
